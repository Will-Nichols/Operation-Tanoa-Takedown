I'd like to start adding some more stuff to the mission today, is there anything that needs to be pushed to master before I pick it back up or am I good to continue off of the last update I pushed?
JmasterToday at 9:55 AM
You're good
I'll merge any changes I made to what you did
JerkinMerkinToday at 9:55 AM
okay cool
check out my post in the general section of discord, you'll appreciate it
JmasterToday at 10:00 AM
Ha that's great lol
JerkinMerkinToday at 10:34 AM
ill go ahead and do the headless client stuff.  what should i name the slot or slots and should there be more than one?
JmasterToday at 10:38 AM
Put two in
name them headlessclient1 and headlessclient2 respectively
JerkinMerkinToday at 10:38 AM
okay
JmasterToday at 11:57 AM
Yo
JerkinMerkinToday at 11:57 AM
sup
JmasterToday at 11:57 AM
So that ace arsenal script I got works
I had it working in the missionfile edit I made
JerkinMerkinToday at 11:58 AM
wierd, it wouldnt work for me along with the other script
JmasterToday at 11:58 AM
Don't worry about implementing it, I can take care of it
which other script?
JerkinMerkinToday at 11:58 AM
no its fine, I'm already working on it actually
the one that converts BI arsenal to ACE arsenal
its alright, I've already taken care of it
JmasterToday at 11:59 AM
?
JerkinMerkinToday at 11:59 AM
I'm also doing loadout pre-sets as we discussed, it works fine and will make all of us happy
JmasterToday at 11:59 AM
It doesn't
And this is going to be discussed at length again
JerkinMerkinToday at 11:59 AM
I figured something out, as I said I would
JmasterToday at 11:59 AM
What you figured out is not acceptable
JerkinMerkinToday at 11:59 AM
ohhhh boy
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:00 PM
do we really want to do this again
JmasterToday at 12:00 PM
Yes.
It never actually ended
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:00 PM
well, I'll have no part in it, and you better think twice if you want to go around swinging your dick like youre in charge of everything.
JmasterToday at 12:00 PM
Cool
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:00 PM
because I will have no part in this development team
JmasterToday at 12:01 PM
What ever
that's your choice
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:01 PM
fine
JmasterToday at 12:01 PM
It's also your choice for your missions not to be run
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:01 PM
I rescind all permissions for you to touch or run my mission
JmasterToday at 12:02 PM
Nothing against you Jerkin, but if it was Nichols was here you wouldn't be having this conversation
Sweet
Go make missions somewhere else
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:02 PM
deal
JmasterToday at 12:02 PM
I've heard 15th is anal about realism
and they use set loadouts
you should fit in just fine
For the record this isn't just a personal issue
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:03 PM
ooof this is fun.  jay on a power trip
JmasterToday at 12:03 PM
Multiple people have said they will leave the community over this issue
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:04 PM
well youre talking to one of them, im so glad youre here to lookout for jay instead of the community
JmasterToday at 12:04 PM
No
I don't care if you leave
at this point it's either You or a couple of other people
I'd rather keep that couple of people
because we can't afford to lose our playerbase
we can afford to lose A mission maker
I would rather not
but if you are going to be difficult so be it
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:05 PM
hey, thats your decision big development head
i hope you stand by it
and i hope you realize you are the ONLY one who has these opinions in the development team
JmasterToday at 12:06 PM
So be it
if I must be the voice of reason I will
If the rest of the development team have their heads that far up their asses then they can leave too
because it's not their job to make missions for themselves
they make them for the community
if they can't accept that people don't want to play the way that YOU want them to
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:07 PM
no, you want to make jmaster missions, not community missions
JmasterToday at 12:07 PM
No
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:07 PM
this isnt fucking exile
JmasterToday at 12:07 PM
I know it isn't
We also aren't a historical reenactment community
We're a milsim community
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:07 PM
you dont know what this community is
JmasterToday at 12:07 PM
It isn't about gear
I do
I was there with Nichols when it was founded
I discussed what we stand for with Nichols
something we both agreed on
This isn't about making "Jmaster missions"
This is about compromising our community tenants because YOU want YOUR mission YOUR way
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:09 PM
what fucking tenants?  show me where the fuck it says I have to put in an arsenal YOUR way
JmasterToday at 12:09 PM
"Milsim without the bullshit"
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:10 PM
dude, Im fucking over it.  youre going to kill this community and ill be laughing as it falls because of your hubris
THAT DOESNT GIVE YOU A BLANKET TO BE A DICTATOR
JmasterToday at 12:10 PM
So long as you put an arsenal with the equiptment required in it there isn't a problem
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:10 PM
IM OUT, FUCK OFF
JmasterToday at 12:10 PM
I don't give two shits what's in it
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:10 PM
THATS EXACTLY WHAT I DID??!
JmasterToday at 12:10 PM
No
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:10 PM
YOU HAVENT EVEN LOOKED
JmasterToday at 12:10 PM
You said you were restricting it to slots
you just did
that is what I'm objecting to
having no arsenal
and just using slots
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:11 PM
ITS PRE-SET LOADOUTS IN THE ARSENAL??
JmasterToday at 12:11 PM
WHICH IS FINE?!
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:11 PM
THERE IS AN ARSENAL
WELL NOW WE HAVE A FUCKING PROBLEM
JmasterToday at 12:11 PM
I'm really confused now
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:11 PM
I DID EXACTLY WHAT YOU ASKED
AND YOU GO OFF ON ME ABOUT HOW ITS NOT ACCEPTABLE
YOU HAVE A FUCKING PROBLEM, BECAUSE YOU CANT SEE PAST YOUR FUCKING EGO
I TOLD YOU I WOULD MAKE IT WORK
YOU HAVE TO FUCKING TRUST ME
JmasterToday at 12:12 PM
I did trust you
until you said that you limited it to what you get in slots?
ie: removing arsenal?
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:12 PM
I NEVER SAID I REMOVED ARSENAL
JmasterToday at 12:13 PM
fucks sakes
I misread that
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:13 PM
YOU JUST STARTED AUTOMATICALLY SWINGING YOUR BIG EGOTISTICAL DICK AT MNE
WELL NOW WE HAVE A FUCKING PROBLEM
JmasterToday at 12:13 PM
No, I thought you were trying to pull a scotty
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:13 PM
GOOD FUCKING JOB JAY
JmasterToday at 12:13 PM
I don't want to micro manage and control missions
All I want is to make sure that people don't fucking leave this community over stupid decisions
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:14 PM
WELL YOU FUCKING ARE.  AND I HAVE NO FAITH IN YOU AS HEAD OF DEVELOPMENT
JmasterToday at 12:14 PM
and we don't have arguments about gear
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:14 PM
NO ARGUMENT IN GEAR GOES BOTH WAYS
JmasterToday at 12:15 PM
We're supposed to be "Milsim without the bullshit"
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:15 PM
this isnt even about the fucking arsenal shit anymore
JmasterToday at 12:15 PM
yet it's come back to arguing about gear
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:15 PM
i cant take this dick swinging contest
JmasterToday at 12:15 PM
dude
if this was Nichols you would have just said Yes
and went with it
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:16 PM
this isnt about nichols
this is about you
JmasterToday at 12:16 PM
Yes,
But Nichols has the power to do the same thing
and has done so in the past
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:17 PM
well, nichols and I go way back to SO MSO, hes made multiple successful milsim missions.   i trust him, and you know what, yea id probably listen to him over you
and you know what
after last night and today
i have zero faith in YOU
JmasterToday at 12:17 PM
Sweet
I love how you can just suddenly strut into the community and suddenly get everything your way
it must be nice going waay back with Nichols
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:19 PM
ow
that hurt
i dont really care what you think about me
doesnt matter anymore since im taking my shit elsewhere
JmasterToday at 12:19 PM
You make decent missions and you are an alright guy
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:20 PM
cool
JmasterToday at 12:20 PM
We disagree on some major issues and I don't think we would be able to work together
But I would happen to remain friends
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:20 PM
apparently not
and that remains to be seen, im kinda pissed off right now
i dont have anything against you personally
but look
JmasterToday at 12:20 PM
I'm pissed off over this as well
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:21 PM
youre only what, 18, 19?
JmasterToday at 12:21 PM
This isn't an ego thing
TF-Red is literally my life
I have no other friends
I DO NOT want to see this fail
at ANY cost
because if it does I don't know what I would do to myself
There have been times when I've contemplated suicide
and I DO NOT want to end up in that dark place again
and I'm not being melodramatic
I'm finally getting my life back in order then this shit with scotty happens
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:23 PM
okay
if i say something wrong its because im pissed off, im not actually trying to say mean shit
go outside, take a vacation
its not worth it
why do you think i leave for months on end sometimes?
cause i need a break from it all
its a video game at the end of the day
JmasterToday at 12:25 PM
tbh that's kinda what I did
its not the game I'm worried about
its the community/people
literally my only friends
even ford
if you had a way to stop your entire friendgroup from leaving you forever would you not do everything on your power to stop it from happening?
This isn't an ego thing for me. I could give less of a fuck about what people on the internet think of me
I don't care about some stupid title in an online gaming community
What I care about is being involved in the direction of this community
I feel that I have put as much work as Nichols into this community
and whether or not I have an owner tag idgaf but its mine as much as it is nichols
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:28 PM
that is exactly the mentality that killed SO and spearhead
JmasterToday at 12:28 PM
I've been there from the start helping on grow
Well then maybe they should have talked it out
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:29 PM
when you feel because you've put in all this work that suddenly you need to be in charge of everything, that called entitlement
JmasterToday at 12:29 PM
like I'm going to do with Nichols today
No
the thing is
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:29 PM
it suddently doesnt make your opinions any more correct
JmasterToday at 12:29 PM
I've always felt that way
Since the beginning I was in charge of development
aka the community development direction
I created the development structure
and I ran it
I was/am the one in charge of it
none of that has changed since the beginning
I don't suddenly think I'm entitled to lead development because I always have
that is my job
and I don't like fighting with people over stupid shit
I even thought of a compromise that might work for you
But that ain't worth shit now
JerkinMerkinToday at 12:34 PM
honestly, i dont give a shit.  you can play development head all you want.  im tired of this coversation and you are not worth my time.  I don't work for you, and if you want to make milsim a certain way,  then you're going to find out very soon that you'll soon be making milsim all by yourself
im out
JmasterToday at 12:34 PM
and I don't work for you
alright suit yourself
it was nice working with you for a while
python is a good mission
You'll definately find someone willing to run it if you are leaving
hell I bet that Auburn's group would love to play it
