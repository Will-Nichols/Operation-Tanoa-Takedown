Commander’s Intent: US Special Operations forces are to make contact with the various local guerilla units which are being led by the leadership known as Kutu which is somewhere in the primary archipelago. Once contact is made it is suggested that all US SOF forces begin FID operations as soon as possible with the intent of forcing the PLA into an untenable position in the Tanoan Archipelago in order to make it easier on a later possible invasion by US and US allied forces staging from Australia.<br/><br/>b. Concept of Operations: Kutu leadership is in overall command of all ground forces for the duration of Operation Tanoa Takedown; 160th SOAR is to provide all transportation functions for US SOF Ground forces whether that be via helicopter or waterborne craft operations.<br/><br/>c. Maneuvers: US SOF Forces are to work in close proximity with local guerilla forces in order to maximize the impact on the PLA unit operations in Tanoa.<br/><br/>d. Coordinating Instructions: The local guerilla leadership known as Kutu is prepared to provide introduction and limited local transport as needed to get US SOF troops into position with the local guerilla movement."

                "At approximately 1600 local time 10 December, the men of the 45th Division (Airborne) completed loading of the Xian Y-20 transport aircraft at the airbase at Huangpi and began the 12-hour flight to their drop zones in the archipelago of Tanoa. At approximately 0600 hours on 11 December the first reports of fighting in the islands were broadcast by the Tanoan television stations. By dawn of the 12 December all major civilian, industrial and military areas in the archipelago were controlled by members of the 45th Airborne Division and the accompanying PLAN Marine and PLARF troops. They were to hold until reinforced by air and sea with the 1st Brigade Marines who embarked on the morning of 12 December from the port of Zhanjiang. It was estimated that they would be landing in the archipelago within 10 days provided they did not run into any US or US allies naval forces along the way. During this time the Chinese military had decided that they would begin ferrying AAA and SAM missile components into Tanoa to build up an air defense zone that would rival the ones built by the Soviet military during the Cold War…<br/><br/>a. Enemy Forces:<br/><br/>45th Division of PLA 15th Airborne Corps and 1st Brigade Marines PLA:<br/><br/>(1) Background: The 45th Division is the current Chinese PLA strategic level Rapid Deployment unit in rotation to move within 24-36 hours on the orders of the Chinese Politburo; while the 1st Brigage PLAN Marines are the premiere combat action force for amphibious warfare and operations in the PLAN.<br/><br/>(2) Capabilities: The 45th Division employs some older but modernized Russian designed light armored vehicles as well as new lightweight combat vehicle variants for airborne delivery operations and reconnaissance units.<br/><br/>(3) Most Probable Course of Action: PLA and PLAN doctrine dictates that the airborne units can expect to be isolated from reinforcement for at least 2 weeks while the naval transportation of the PLAN units arrives. During this time the Airborne forces will work to establish friendly relations with the new local government and work to drive out any and all insurgency activity while preparing for heavy equipment and enginneers to be airlifted or floated into the theater as available.<br/><br/>PRC SOF Units in Theater:<br/><br/>(1) Background: Very little is known about the SOF units within the PLA; it is suspected that they have been armed with foreign weapons and technology systems to allow them to operate in foreign countries without raising suspicions. CIA and DIA briefing packets hint at the possible training on a par with the higher level of special operations forces within the USSOCOM and JSOC. It is also believed that this unit is working closely with the 45th Division commander to track down local insurgency groups and to train up local sympathsizers as a reserve combat force to augment the 45th Division while they wait on the 1st Marine PLAN to arrive.<br/><br/>
				
				(2) Capabilities: Chinese Air Force Y-9 and Y-20 transports have been arriving regularly brining in airmobile weapon systems for SAM and AAA defense sites that are being established all across the islands. These weapon systems represent a massive obstacle to any and all resupply until they are located and destroyed by the local guerillas and US SOF troops.<br/><br/>(3) Most Probable Course of Action: The vast majority of Chinese PLA, PLARF and PLAN activity is in the areas around Blue Pearl Industrial Port, Ljinhaven, Georgetown, La Rochelle, Tuvanaka and Harcourt. There is a limited enemy presence on the southwestern islands which are where the locals have been fighting to keep the Chinese military from taking hold. This fighting is expected to continue for another 36 hours or so until the Chinese are able to move heavy forces onto the islands there using their airlift systems. The heaviest fighting there is located near the town of Katkoula and Balavu.<br/><br/>b. Friendly Forces - Task Unit Red:<br/><br/>US SOCOM units ODA775 and 160th SOAR detachment<br/><br/>The local insurgency forces are extremely limited in the weapon systems and vehicles that they are able to utilize. They are predominately former Tanoan Marines and civilians who are opposed to the Chinese led CSAT invasion.<br/><br/>It is believed that the leader who goes by Kutu is a former Tanoan Marine leader but the US intelligence services are unable to verify at this time due to the limited knowledge we had prior to this invasion of the members of the Tanoan Defense Forces and their private nature as a predominately local police and security force for the archipelago. During the brief satellite comms conversation with Kutu one of the officers at the Pentagon thought he recognized the voice as one of the former leaders that was working with the US Ambassador to have US forces assist with training TDF. If so then this individual is a highly prized contact and must be protected at all costs."
